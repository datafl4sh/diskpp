## DiSk++ tutorial 1: iteration on mesh elements
This tutorial shows how to create an uniform mesh on the unit square/cube,
how to iterate on it and how to retrieve some basic properties of the elements,
like the diameter, the measure (length/area/volume), the barycenter and so on.
Iterating on mesh elements is a core operation, as the assembly of your
discrete numerical problem depends on this.

## DiSk++ tutorial 2: outputting data for visualization
DiSk++ relies on SILO (https://github.com/LLNL/Silo/) and
VisIt (https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/) for data output and
visualization. This tutorial shows how to use the wrapper around SILO provided
by DiSk++ to plot a simple function.
